.. note::
    The analyser includes a "run" script at the top of the project folder structure. This sets up
    the Virtual Environment and passes command line arguments supplied to the script through to the
    analyser. This simplifies running the application so it's recommended, though not mandatory, to
    use it. This document assumes it is being used.
